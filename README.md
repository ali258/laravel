# Laravel

## What is composer?
Composer is a dependency manager for PHP And with the help of the composer we don't need to install the dependencies manually. Every dependency is installed by the composer automatically in the vendor folder.

Download Composer by this [Site](https://getcomposer.org/download/).

Check composer version :
```
composer
```


## Install laravel?

You can install laravel by this command.
```
composer global require laravel/installer
```
You can run this command only one time.

Check laravel version :
```
laravel
```

Check php version :
```
php -v
```

Now go to your working directory.

```
cd Users\username
cd documents\GitHub
cd repository_name
```

Everytime you need to add a project on **Laravel**.
Run this command :
```
laravel new project_name
```
